Team 11 [STRIDEZ] Create-a-thon Project! 

We chose topic 5, Physical Health and Mental Well-being Management.

Crohnâ€™s disease can cause people to experience painful flare-ups triggered by certain foods. These flare-ups can lead to severe physical pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that make it difficult to live everyday life. Identifying which foods cause these flare-ups, and which foods are safe can be challenging.

This project aims to help by tracking foods and correlating them with symptoms. By analyzing eating patterns and symptom logs, it can:
 - Identify foods that may trigger flare-ups.
 - Highlight foods that appear safe to eat.
 - Provide personalized recommendations for trying new foods with lower risk.

Our app, Crohnalyze, is intended to give users a streamlined, intelligent way to make informed food choices and improve their quality of life.
